# What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is defined as an open source machine learning library for Python. It is used for applications such as natural language processing. It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber’s Pyro software for probabilistic programming which is built on it.

Originally, PyTorch was developed by Hugh Perkins as a Python wrapper for the LusJIT based on Torch framework.

PyTorch redesigns and implements Torch in Python while sharing the same core C libraries for the backend code. PyTorch developers tuned this back-end code to run Python efficiently. They also kept the GPU based hardware acceleration as well as the extensibility features that made Lua-based Torch.

# PyTorch Deep Learning Model Life-Cycle
In this section, you will discover the life-cycle for a deep learning model and the PyTorch API that you can use to define models.
A model has a life-cycle, and this very simple knowledge provides the backbone for both modeling a dataset and understanding the PyTorch API.

The five steps in the life-cycle are as follows:
* 1. Prepare the Data.
* 2. Define the Model.
* 3. Train the Model.
* 4. Evaluate the Model.
* 5. Make Predictions.

Let’s take a closer look at each step in turn.

Note: There are many ways to achieve each of these steps using the PyTorch API, although I have aimed to show you the simplest, or most common, or most idiomatic.
